## Setup

* Flutter & Dart Compiled Code

   Please download Flutter & Dart for development from [here](https://flutter.io/get-started/install/), and follow the instruction to complete the configuration for either iOS/Android development.

   For now, the latest release of Flutter is [Flutter Release Preview 2.](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/09/flutter-release-preview-2-pixel-perfect.html).

   The next version of Flutter will finally be 1.0 ðŸŽ‰

   **Warning: We highly recommend you to download and config Flutter prior to coming to this workshop as it may take 30 - 60 minutes to complete the process. If you do not have Flutter correctly installed, you might only be able to attend an info-session of mobile app dev in Flutter rather than a hands-on session.**

* Visual Studio Code (or Xcode, Android Studio, IntelliJ for Dart Programming)

    Use the recommended editor/IDE for Flutter development. Refer to [here](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/).

* Complete Setup
    
    Use `flutter doctor` in your terminal/cmd to check everything is correct with at least one editor/IDE is working.

## Live Streaming:

[![NTUOSS-FlutterWorkshop](./img/NTUOSS-Logo.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHGb2NOMiQ0)

## Flutter
* Key Advandatages:
    * Hot reload 
    * Cross Platform
    * Compiled to Native Code
    * Support untyped and typed data declaration 
    > `var`, `dynamic` vs `String`, `double`, `Map<String, double>`
    * build-in unit testing

* Key differences:
    * No built-in UI designing Kit
    * Inline styles
    > `Colors`, `Alignment`, `EdgeInsect`
    * Extended styles
    > `TextDecoration` and `AnimationController`
    * Gesture control
    > `GestureDetector`
    * [Cupertino Style Component for iOS development](https://flutter.io/widgets/cupertino/)

**use `git checkout <branch-name>` to get the source code of different apps**

## HELLO WORLD
```bash
# > To view the source code.
$ git checkout feature/currencyapp
```
* `Hello World App` of Flutter
    * Classes in Flutter
    * State Machine in Flutter
    * Arguments in Stateful Classes
    * Class initialization shortcut
    * Add assets
    * Unit testing in Flutter

With Flutter installed, Check everything is correct with 
```bash
$ flutter doctor
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[âœ“] Flutter (Channel beta, v0.9.4, on Mac OS X 10.14 18A391, locale en-SG)
[âœ“] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 28.0.1)
[âœ“] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 10.0)
[âœ“] Android Studio (version 3.1)
[âœ“] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2018.2)
[âœ“] VS Code (version 1.28.2)
[âœ“] Connected devices (1 available)

â€¢ No issues found!
```
> If you do not have connected devices error, connect your phone to computer (For iOS developer make sure your device has trusted your computer to install app on in. Read [here](https://flutter.io/setup-macos/#platform-setup).)

> You can connect a simulator(Xcode) or an emulator(Android Studio) for development as well.

Then we can get started by running
```bash
flutter create myapp
```
This command will create a flutter project folder for you named `myapp`

Then we can change directory into our project folder and start to run the project
```bash
$ cd myapp
$ flutter run
```
Now you should have a counter app running in your device.

### VOICE RECOGNITION
* `Speech Recognition App` Method Channel
    * Implement native APIs that Flutter does not support

We can make use of `MethodChannel` in both platform.

Checkout the repository [here](https://github.com/ZaynJarvis/Flutter-Speech-Recognition)


> In Flutter (Dart), we create the channel we will use. In this case, a generic name `speech_recognizer`. Then we specify the function to integrate with native APIs.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

const MethodChannel _speech_channel =
    const MethodChannel("speech_recognizer");

class SpeechRecognizer {
  static void setMethodCallHandler(handler) {
    _speech_channel.setMethodCallHandler(handler);
  }

  static Future activate() {
    return _speech_channel.invokeMethod("activate");
  }

  static Future start(String lang) {
    return _speech_channel.invokeMethod("start", lang);
  }

  static Future cancel() {
    return _speech_channel.invokeMethod("cancel");
  }

  static Future stop() {
    return _speech_channel.invokeMethod("stop");
  }
}
```
> In Android (Java), we connect to the channel `speech_recognizer` to receive message. Then deal with the method call received from Flutter.

```java
public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity implements RecognitionListener {

    private static final String SPEECH_CHANNEL = "speech_recognizer";
    private static final String LOG_TAG = "SPEAKTEST";
    private SpeechRecognizer speech;
    private MethodChannel speechChannel;
    String transcription = "";
    private boolean cancelled = false;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(this);

        speech = SpeechRecognizer.createSpeechRecognizer(getApplicationContext());
        speech.setRecognitionListener(this);

        final Intent recognizerIntent = new Intent(RecognizerIntent.ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH);
        recognizerIntent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS, true);
        recognizerIntent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_MAX_RESULTS, 3);

        speechChannel = new MethodChannel(getFlutterView(), SPEECH_CHANNEL);
        speechChannel.setMethodCallHandler(
                new MethodChannel.MethodCallHandler() {
                    @Override
                    public void onMethodCall(MethodCall call, MethodChannel.Result result) {
                        switch(call.method){
                            case "activate":
                                result.success(true);
                                break;
                            case "start":
                                cancelled = false;
                                speech.startListening(recognizerIntent);
                                result.success(true);
                                break;
                            case "cancel":
                                speech.stopListening();
                                cancelled = true;
                                result.success(true);
                                break;
                            case "stop":
                                speech.stopListening();
                                cancelled = false;
                                result.success(true);
                                break;
                            default:
                                result.notImplemented();
                        }
                    }
                }
        );
    }
}
```
```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import Speech

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate, SFSpeechRecognizerDelegate {

  private let speechRecognizerEn = SFSpeechRecognizer(locale: Locale(identifier: "en_US"))!

  private var speechChannel: FlutterMethodChannel?

  private var recognitionRequest: SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest?

  private var recognitionTask: SFSpeechRecognitionTask?

  private let audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()

  override func application(
     _ application: UIApplication,
     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    let controller: FlutterViewController = window?.rootViewController as! FlutterViewController

    speechChannel = FlutterMethodChannel.init(name: "speech_recognizer",
       binaryMessenger: controller)
    speechChannel!.setMethodCallHandler({
      (call: FlutterMethodCall, result: @escaping FlutterResult) -> Void in
      if ("start" == call.method) {
        self.startRecognition(lang: call.arguments as! String, result: result)
      } else if ("stop" == call.method) {
        self.stopRecognition(result: result)
      } else if ("cancel" == call.method) {
        self.cancelRecognition(result: result)
      } else if ("activate" == call.method) {
        self.activateRecognition(result: result)
      } else {
        result(FlutterMethodNotImplemented)
      }
    })
    return true
  }
}
```
